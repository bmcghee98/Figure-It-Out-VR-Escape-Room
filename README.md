# Figure It Out: VR Escape Room

“Figure It Out” is an interactive VR escape room with the central goal of exercising and revitalizing the areas of the brain involved with problem-solving and attention to detail. Players are placed into a classroom setting and are given a series of tasks to solve in order to unlock the room and exit, effectively completing the game. These tasks range from: identifying color and symbol patterns, locating clues hidden in certain areas, moving and placing objects in different areas of the room, and triggering events to progress the story.

## How to Run

```
1. Run "git clone https://github.com/bmcghee98/Figure-It-Out-VR-Escape-Room.git" from the command terminal
2. Connect the Oculus Rift (or an Oculus Quest 2 using a link cable) to the PC
3. Open the project folder and run the "CS135 F2" executable
4. Have fun!
```
Due to the pandemic, creating virtual worlds such as these are more relevant than ever. We believe our project would be interesting to people who desire a genuine escape room experience from the comfort of their own home. With the help of VR, people can once again have fun solving problems that test their knowledge and wit. Although VR is a simulation of reality, VR games have the potential to be even more immersive and challenging. With VR, escape rooms can be created from a much more dynamic perspective. There are no real-world limitations that would typically hinder flexibility in designing unique challenges. For example, there are a few clues in our game that could not have been implemented as effectively in a real-world escape room. Regardless, whether it is through solving riddles, completing interactive puzzles or successfully identifying clues, players will be given an authentic, fully developed experience.
